## Architecture

### Hybrid Rendering

The application uses a hybrid rendering approach for optimal performance and
security:

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**

  - Public-facing pages (home, about, contact) are statically generated at build
    time
  - Static data is revalidated every hour
  - Enhanced with client-side interactivity where needed
  - Optimized for performance and SEO

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
  - Admin panel is server-rendered for real-time data and security
  - Protected by server-side authentication checks
  - Automatic redirects for unauthorized access
  - Real-time data updates with optimistic UI

### Testing Strategy

The project employs a comprehensive testing approach:

- **End-to-End Testing (Cypress)**

  - Tests complete user flows and critical paths
  - Covers authentication and authorization
  - Tests responsive design across different viewports
  - Verifies API integration and data persistence
  - Ensures proper error handling

- **Unit Testing (Jest)**
  - Tests individual components in isolation
  - Verifies component logic and state management
  - Tests hooks and utility functions
  - Ensures proper rendering and props handling
  - Mocks external dependencies for reliable tests
